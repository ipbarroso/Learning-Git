#Removing files:
* Make sure after file was removed from folder to add changes to git repository
* You can use git rm filename (or pattern) to remove files from directory and staging area at the same time

#Old committs:
* Whenever we go back with git checkout, we are taking off the main branch, we can go back with git checkout master.
